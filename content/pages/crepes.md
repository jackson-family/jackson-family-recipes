From http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~roy/Crepes/MakingCrepes.html, adapted by William

Ingredients

* Eggs (4)
* Salt (¼ tsp)
* Flour (2 cups)
* Milk (2¼ cups)
* Butter or margarine (¼ cup, melted)

Directions

Break the eggs into a bowl. Add salt and whisk together until uniformly yellow.

Add some flour and milk alternately while whisking until you have added it all.

Add the melted butter and whisk until smooth.

Use about ¼ cup of batter for an 8 inch skillet. Heat the pan to a medium heat. As you pour the batter, twirl the pan around to make an even coating. When it no longer looks moist, flip it and cook the other side. The crepe should slide around when it is ready.

Fillings

You can put anything in a crepe:

* Jelly, jam, Nutella or even sprinkled sugar.
* A slice of lunch meat and cheese.
