Tupperware

* 2-1/2 to 3 cups all purpose flour
* 1 pkg yeast (1 Tbs)
* 2 Tbs oil
* 1 tsp salt

In a mixing bowl combine 1-1/4 cup flour, yeast, and salt.  Stir in 1 cup warm water and oil.  Beat slowly for 1/2 min.  Beat 3 min on high.  

Stir in flour with a spoon.  Knead on a lightly floured board enough flour to make a medium-stiff dough which is smooth and elastic.  Cover dough and let rise for 10 min.  Divide dough in half, roll out to 13" circle and transfer to 12" pan.  Build up edges.  Add Pizza Sauce and toppings. Bake at 425Â° for 15 min.
