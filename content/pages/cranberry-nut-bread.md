* 1 cup sugar
* 2 tsp baking powder
* 1/2 tsp baking soda
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 1/2 cup nuts
* 2 tsp coarsely grated orange rind

Heat oven to 350Â°.  Grease and flour a 9x5x3-inch loaf pan.  In a large mixing bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt; stir in nuts and coarse orange rind; set aside.

In a small mixing bowl, combine orange juice, mayonnaise and eggs; beat until well blended.  Stir egg mixture into dry ingredients, mixing just until flour is moistened.  Fold in cranberries.  Pour into prepared pan.  Combine 2 Tbs sugar and 1 tsp orange rind; sprinkle over top of loaf.

Bake for 60 to 70 minutes or until done using toothpick test.  Cover with foil last 10 minutes to prevent excessive browning.  Remove from pan and cool on wire rack.  When cool, wrap in foil and refrigerate.
