* 1 medium eggplant, thinly sliced
* 1 large tomato, thinly sliced
* 1 large onion, thinly sliced
* 1/4 cup melted butter or margarine
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1/2 tsp dried basil
* 1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
* 2 Tbs grated parmesan cheese
* pizza pepperoni

Layer first 3 ingredents in a greased 13"x9"x2"  baking dish.  Drizzle with butter.  Sprinkle with salt and basil.  Cover and bake at 450Â° for 25-30 min. or until eggplant is tender.  Uncover and sprinkle with mozzarella cheese, parmesan cheese, and pepperoni.  Bake uncovered 5 min. or until cheese melts.

I have made several layers in a smaller dish.  Be sure to season each layer.  You may need to bake longer to cook eggplant.
