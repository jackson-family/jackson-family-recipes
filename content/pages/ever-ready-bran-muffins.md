title: Ever-Ready Bran Muffins
tags: breads

From Atlanta Journal Constitution

* 15oz package wheat bran flakes with raisins (try Raisin Bran)
* 5 cups all purpose flour
* 3 cups sugar
* 1 Tbsp (tablespoon) plus 2 tsp (teaspoon) baking soda
* 2 tsp salt
* 4 eggs, beaten
* 1 quart (4 cups) buttermilk
* 1 cup vegetable oil

Combine first 5 ingredients in a very large bowl; make a well in center of mixture. Add eggs, buttermilk and oil, stir
just enough to moisten dry ingredients. Cover and store in refrigerator until ready to bake. Batter can be kept in
refrigerator up to 6 weeks.

To bake, spoon batter into greased muffin pans (or paper cup lined muffin pans) until 2/3 full. Bake at 400° for 12-15
minutes. Cool on wire rack.

Makes about 5½ dozen.

Tips from Mom:

These freeze very well in zip lock bags. I have used plain wheat flakes and added raisins, craisins (dried cranberries)
and golden raisins all at different times, not all at once. All are delicious.
