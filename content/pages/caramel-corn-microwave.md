Julia Garrett

Put the following in a brown grocery bag and set aside:

8 quarts popped popcorn (seeded)
nuts (if desired)

Mix well in a 1-quart glass dish:

1 stick margarine, melted
1 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup Karo syrup
1/2 tsp salt

Cook the mixture on high in microwave for 3-1/2 min.  Take mixture out of microwave and add:

1/2 tsp baking soda

Stir well (mixture will foam).

Pour caramel on popcorn in bag and shake it up.  Close bag and cook in microwave 1-1/2 minutes on high.

Take out and shake well to coat the popcorn thoroughly.  Cook again for 1 min.
