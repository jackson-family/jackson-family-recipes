* 1/2 cup small curd creamed cottage cheese
* 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese

* 2 eggs
* 1 tsp salt

Heat oven to 400Â°.  Grease pie plate, 10" x 1-1/2".  Cook and stir ground beef over medium heat until brown; drain.  Stir in oregano, basil, tomato paste, and 1/2 cup of the mozzarella cheese.

Layer cottage cheese and Parmesan cheese in plate.  Spoon beef mixture over top.  Beat milk, baking mix, eggs, salt, and pepper until smooth, 15 seconds in blender on high, or 1 minute with hand beater.  Pour into plate.

Bake until knife inserted between center and edge comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes.  Sprinkle with remaining cheese.  Cool 5 minutes.  Serves 6 to 8.
