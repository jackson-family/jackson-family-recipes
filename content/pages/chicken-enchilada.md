title: Chicken Enchilada

Linda Coplin

* 2-1/2 to 3 lbs chicken or turkey
* 1 can cream of mushroom soup
* 1 can cream of chicken soup
* 1 can Rotel tomatoes*
* 1 can chopped green chilies
* 10-12 oz shredded cheese
* 12 or more corn tortillas

Or substitute chopped onion or onion powder, garlic salt or powder, green peppers (opt.), and green chilies (opt.)

Boil and debone chicken, breaking into bite-sized pieces.  Break tortillas into bite-sized pieces.  Make a sauce of the soups, cheese, tomatoes and chilis and a little broth; heat until cheese is melted.

Pour a little both into a greased casserole dish (to prevent sticking).  Layer chicken, sauce, and tortillas into the dish.  Additional cheese and chilis may be added as a topping before baking.  Bake at 350Â° about 30 min.
