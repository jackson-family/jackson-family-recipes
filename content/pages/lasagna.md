Cook 12-14 Lasagna noodles and drain

Saute all together:

* 2 lbs ground beef
* 1 clove garlic or garlic powder
* 2 tsp salt
* 1/4 tsp pepper
* 1 tsp oregano
* 2 6-oz cans tomato paste (Note 1)

Add 3 cups water and simmer while noodles cook.

Arrange some meat sauce in bottom of a 9"x13" baking pan, arrange noodles for next layer, continue until last layer of noodles is placed on top.  Cover noodles with 1 12-oz carton of cottage cheese.  Cover with sliced or grated mozzarella cheese and top with remaining meat sauce.  

Bake 1 hour at 350Â°.  Let stand 5 min before serving.  Great reheated.

Note 1.  Instead of tomato paste and 3 cups water, use 1 qt tomato sauce and only 1/2 cup water.
