* 3 cups sugar
* 1-1/4 cup white corn syrup
* 1/2 cup water
* 4 cups raw Spanish peanuts

Boil sugar, syrup and water over high burner until temperature reaches 250° on candy thermometer.  Add raw peanuts,
stirring constantly. Cook to 300°. Without stirring, add 3 teaspoons margarine. Allow margarine to melt.

Remove from stove. Quickly stir in 1 teaspoon vanilla and 2-1/2 teaspoons baking soda. Pour onto buttered cookie sheets,
spreading as thin as possible with a spoon. Let cool. Break into pieces when cold.
