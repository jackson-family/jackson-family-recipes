title: Fruit 'n Yogurt Pie

Ellen Jackson

2 cups prepared yogurt (may be homemade or plain commercial)
1/2 cup sugar
3/4 cup mashed strawberries
1 (8-oz) container whipped topping or
1 cup whipped whipping cream
1 prepared 8- or 9-inch graham cracker crust

Thoroughly combine mashed fruit, sugar and yogurt in a bowl.  Fold in whipped topping, blend well.  Spoon into crust and freeze about 4 hours.  

Remove from freezer before serving (solidly frozen pie may require more time in refrigerator for softer texture).  Store any leftover pie in the freezer.

For other fruits try:

3/4 cup mashed blueberries, raspberries or canned fruit such as peaches and 
apricot halves, drained and mashed or 
1 (8 oz) can crushed pineapple, drained.
