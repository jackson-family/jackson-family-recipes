title: Royal Frosting

* 2 egg whites
* 1 tsp lemon juice
* 3-1/2 cups powdered sugar

Beat egg whites and lemon juice in medium sized bowl until foamy.  Slowly beat in sugar until frosting stands in still peaks and holds a sharp line when cut through with a knife.  More or less powdered sugar may be added for the desired consistency.

Note:  Keep this frosting in an airtight container.  It will dry out quickly.
