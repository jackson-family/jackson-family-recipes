title: Freezer Bread Dough

Tupperware

* 5-3/4 to 6-1/4 cups all-purpose flour
* 2 Tbs active dry yeast (2 pkgs)
* 2 cups milk
* 6 Tbs margarine
* 1/3 cup sugar
* 2 tsp salt
* 2 eggs

In large mixing bowl, combine 2-1/2 cups of flour and the yeast.  In saucepan, heat together the milk, margarine, sugar, and salt until just warm (115째 to 120째), stirring constantly until margarine almost melts.  Add liquid and eggs to dry ingredients in mixing bowl.  Beat at low speed with electric mixer for 1/2 minute, scraping sides of bowl constantly.  Beat 3 minutes at high speed.  Stir in as much of the remaining flour as you can mix with a spoon.  Turn out onto a lightly floured pastry sheet.  Knead in enough of the remaining flour to make a stiff dough that is smooth and
elastic (6 to 8 minutes total).  Divide dough into thirds.

Makes 3 loaves.  Use portions for bread or cinnamon rolls or plain dinner rolls.  Allow time for raising and bake at 350째 for bread and 375째 for rolls.
