Ingredients

* Bacon (8 slices, crisply fried and crumbled) or sausage (1/4 lb cooked and drained)

Directions

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Grease a 10 inch pie plate.

Sprinkle the bacon, cheese and onion into the plate.

Beat the milk, Bisquick, eggs, salt and pepper together until smooth -- 15 seconds in a blender on high speed or 1 minute with a hand mixer. Pour into the plate.

Bake 35 to 40 minutes, until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean.

Cool 5 minutes before serving.
