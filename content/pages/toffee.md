* 1 cup butter
* 1 cup granulated sugar

Melt butter.  Take off stove and add sugar.  Stir until butter is mixed in completely.  Cook stirring constantly until temperature reaches 280° to 300° and mixture changes from a honey color to a caramel color.

Pour into ungreased pan(s) (two 9" round pans or one 9"x13" pan) and spread out.  Sprinkle on chocolate chips and spread the chocolate when melted.  Cover with finely chopped nuts.
