title: Biscuits

Makes 10

Ingredients:

* 2 cups flour
* 1 Tbs baking powder
* 2 tsp sugar
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 1/2 cup shortening, butter or margarine
* 2/3 cup milk

Directions:

In a bowl stir together flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt.  Cut in shortening until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Make a well in the center and add milk all at once.  Stir just until dough clings together.

On a lightly floured surface, knead dough gently for 10-12 strokes.  Roll or pat dough to 1/2 inch thickness.  Cut with a 2-1/2 inch biscuit cutter, dipping cutter into flour between cuts.

Transfer biscuits to a baking sheet.  Bake in a 450Â° oven for 10 to 12 min or until golden brown.
