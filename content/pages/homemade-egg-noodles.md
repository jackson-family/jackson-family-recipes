Beat together in a small bowl:

* 1 egg
* 2 Tbs milk
* 1/4 tsp salt

Add 1 cup flour.

Mix together into a stiff dough.  Let rest 10 minutes.  Roll out on a well floured board until very thin (about an 18"x20" rectangle).  Let stand 20 minutes or longer.  Roll dough up loosely; slice 1/4 inch wide.  Unroll, spread out, and let dry 2 hours.  Makes 6 ounces of noodles or about 3 cups.

Drop noodles slowly into rapidly boiling soup.  Boil uncovered for 10-15 minutes.   Makes a great addition to chicken vegetable soup.
